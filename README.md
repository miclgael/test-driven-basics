# Test Driven Basics
🧪📚👩🏻‍🎓

I am learning to write unit tests, to make more maintainable, self-documenting code. 💁‍♀️

![jest.png](All tests passing feels nice!)

This is a reference for learning purposes. You can pull it down and write your own tests.

1. Starting with no test runner or functions write basic tests with `throw new Error()`
2. Make the tests pass ✅ by writing functions
3. When all of these basic tests pass, convert the tests to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
4. When everything passes with Jest... commit!

## Getting Started

Get up and running:

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) so you can install jest with npm

Do that with

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

The whole point is to run tests :)

If you type

```bash
npm run test
```

This is a shortcut for 

```
jest --watchAll
```

Everything in the repo will be tests. You can make changes and the tests will re-run on every save.
